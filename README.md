*This package is under heavy development, anything may change!*

This is a subset of sql, over Golang code. the idea is to interact with Go code in sql. the tables are dynamic and adding column/table is possible.

## What is this?

```
go get -u github.com/fzerorubigd/goql/...

```

A test command line is built in your GOBIN directory 

```
goql --package="fmt" "select * from files"
goql --package="fmt" "select * from funcs"
goql --package="fmt" "select * from consts"
goql --package="fmt" "select * from vars"
goql --package="fmt" "select * from types"
goql --package="fmt" "select * from imports"
```

also some operators are available: 

```
goql --package="fmt" "select name from funcs where receiver is not null and name like '%print' order by name desc limit 10,1"
```

## TODO

its in alpha stage, there is a long todo list :

- Write documentation
- Definition type and operator 
- UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE support (Yes, code generation with sql)
